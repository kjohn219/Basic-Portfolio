                                    Hi, I was born and raised in Alpharetta Georgia. I never been once moved out of Georgia. Growing up I was always playing a sport. 
                                    I really took to Softball, I played slow pitch up until 5th grade then transitioned into fast pitch. Once I was in 8th grade I completely
                                    changed courses and started rowing. I joined AJRA and after school eveyrday I would carpool down to Roswell for practice. With having
                                    practice 6 days a week and races at least once a month I unfortunately got burned out and did not row my senior year of high school.I 
                                    ended up going to Kennesaw State University. It took a little while to decide on a major, but finally graduated with a Mathematics degree.</p>
